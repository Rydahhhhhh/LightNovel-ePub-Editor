# EPUB Light Novel Parser & Editor

This project is a tool for parsing and editing EPUB files, primarily geared towards light novels. It includes functionality to:

- Extract and modify metadata, such as title, genres, and description, from EPUB files.
- Connect to [RanobeDB](https://ranobedb.org/) API to fetch metadata for light novels, enabling users to quickly populate or update metadata for their EPUB collections.

**Note**: The project is currently in a basic, early stage of development.

## Features

- **EPUB Metadata Parsing**: Handles EPUB 2.x and EPUB 3.x formats, enabling users to read and edit book properties.
- **RanobeDB Metadata Integration**: Integrates with RanobeDB to fetch detailed metadata for light novels, including title, author, and genre, simplifying metadata management.
- **Basic Editing Capabilities**: Provides limited editing functionality for EPUB metadata, aiming to expand in future versions.

## Getting Started

This project is built in GDScript and requires [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).


## Roadmap

- Have it actually do what the readme says
- Also documentation :)
